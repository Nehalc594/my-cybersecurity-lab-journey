---

## What This Room Covers
- Purpose of core networking protocols
- How devices communicate using standardized rules
- Role of protocols in reliable data transfer

## Key Concepts
- Protocols define how data is formatted and transmitted
- Different protocols serve different purposes (communication, transfer, resolution)
- Protocol misuse or misconfiguration can introduce security risks

## Security Perspective
- Offensive: attackers abuse weak or outdated protocols
- Defensive: defenders secure, monitor, and restrict protocol usage

## Key Takeaways
- Protocol knowledge is critical for traffic analysis
- Legacy protocols often increase risk
- Secure configurations reduce protocol-based attacks
