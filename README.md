# Penetration Testing & Cyber Security — Documentation

This repository is a **structured, concept-driven documentation of my cybersecurity learning journey** based on the TryHackMe platform.

It reflects my understanding of **penetration testing, web security, network security, vulnerability research, privilege escalation, and security tooling** — documented in a clean, professional, and ethical manner.

> ⚠️ This repository focuses on **concepts, methodologies, and security thinking**.  
> It intentionally avoids step-by-step exploitation commands or weaponized content.

This is **not** a cheat sheet, exploit dump, or hacking tutorial.
