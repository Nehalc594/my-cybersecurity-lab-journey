# Cyber Security (Documented Learning Portfolio)

This repository documents my completion of the **Cyber Security basic fundamentals**.  
It is structured as a **clean, concept-focused portfolio** that demonstrates foundational cybersecurity knowledge, security thinking, and professional discipline.

> This repository intentionally avoids exploit code, payloads, or step-by-step attack instructions.  
> The focus is on **understanding, security principles, and defensive awareness**.
