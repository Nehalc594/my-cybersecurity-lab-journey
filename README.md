# Penetration Testing & Cyber Security — Documentation

This repository is a **structured, concept-driven documentation of my cybersecurity learning journey** based on the TryHackMe platform.

It reflects my understanding of **penetration testing, web security, network security, vulnerability research, privilege escalation, and security tooling** — documented in a clean, professional, and ethical manner.

> ⚠️ This repository focuses on **concepts, methodologies, and security thinking**.  
> It intentionally avoids step-by-step exploitation commands or weaponized content.

## Purpose of This Repository

The goals of this repository are to:

- Document core cybersecurity concepts learned through TryHackMe
- Demonstrate structured security thinking and methodology
- Show understanding beyond tool usage
- Provide a recruiter-safe and professional knowledge reference
- Serve as a long-term personal security knowledge base

This is **not** a cheat sheet, exploit dump, or hacking tutorial.

## Learning Platform Reference

All topics documented here are based on learning paths and rooms from:

**TryHackMe (THM)**  
A hands-on cybersecurity learning platform covering both offensive and defensive security.

The documentation reflects **my own understanding**, written in my own words, and organized independently of the platform UI.

- ❌ Does NOT provide step-by-step attack walkthroughs
- ❌ Does NOT encourage unauthorized testing

Instead, it focuses on:
- Understanding *why* vulnerabilities exist
- How attackers think
- How defenders detect and mitigate threats
- How security decisions are made in real environments
