# Penetration Tester – Learning Portfolio (TryHackMe)

This section documents my penetration testing learning path using authorized labs (TryHackMe).  
It is written to demonstrate **methodology, security thinking, and clear technical communication**.

> This documentation is intentionally **non-weaponized**: no payloads, exploit code, or step-by-step instructions for unauthorized activity.  
> The focus is on **process, concepts, and defensive awareness**.

---

## Objectives

- Build strong penetration testing fundamentals aligned to real workflows
- Demonstrate structured thinking: recon → enumeration → validation → reporting
- Create a recruiter-safe portfolio that reflects ethical practice
- Develop lightweight helper tooling that supports analysis and reporting

---

## Methodology Focus

This documentation emphasizes:

1. **Scoping & Rules of Engagement**
   - Authorization, boundaries, and safe testing practices

2. **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**
   - Identifying exposed services and application behavior

3. **Vulnerability Identification**
   - Mapping observations to common weakness patterns

4. **Exploitation (High-Level Validation)**
   - Validating impact responsibly within scope

5. **Post-Exploitation Awareness**
   - Understanding impact, lateral movement risk, and persistence concepts

6. **Reporting**
   - Clear risk communication, evidence, and actionable remediation guidance

## Structure

- `sections/`  
  Notes organized by topic/room with:
  - What the concept/tool is
  - Why it matters in a pentest
  - What defenders should monitor or harden
  - Key takeaways

- `tools/` (added next)  
  Small, safe helper scripts/templates to support:
  - Recon/enumeration summarization
  - Evidence organization
  - Reporting consistency

---

## Ethical Statement

All work referenced here was completed:
- In authorized lab environments (TryHackMe)
- For educational and defensive awareness purposes
- With a focus on responsible, professional security practices

---

## Next Steps

Planned improvements:
- Add `tools/` helpers for recon and reporting
- Add a clean reporting template and sample sanitized findings format
- Expand topics with stronger “defender’s view” mapping (detection + prevention)
