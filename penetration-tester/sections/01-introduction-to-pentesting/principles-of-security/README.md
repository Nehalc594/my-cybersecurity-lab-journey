# Principles of Security

This section covers **fundamental security principles** that guide secure system and application design.

Penetration testers rely on these principles to:
- Identify weak designs
- Explain why vulnerabilities exist
- Communicate risk in a way defenders understand

## Why Security Principles Matter in Pentesting

Most real-world vulnerabilities are not random mistakes.  
They occur because **core security principles were violated** during design or implementation.

Understanding principles allows testers to:
- Predict where weaknesses may exist
- Identify systemic risk, not just individual bugs
- Provide meaningful remediation guidance

## Least Privilege

**Definition:**  
Users and processes should have only the access required to perform their function.

**Pentesting relevance:**
- Excessive permissions enable privilege escalation
- Broad access increases blast radius after compromise

**Attacker mindset:**  
“If I gain access here, what else can I reach?”

---

## Defense in Depth

**Definition:**  
Security should rely on multiple independent controls, not a single barrier.

**Pentesting relevance:**
- Single-point failures are high-risk
- Bypassing one control should not equal full compromise

**Attacker mindset:**  
“What happens after the first control fails?”

---

## Secure by Design

**Definition:**  
Security must be considered during system design, not added later.

**Pentesting relevance:**
- Design flaws are harder to fix than coding bugs
- Insecure workflows often enable logic-based attacks

**Attacker mindset:**  
“Does the workflow assume trust where it shouldn’t?”

---

## Fail Securely

**Definition:**  
Systems should fail in a safe, predictable way.

**Pentesting relevance:**
- Error handling can expose sensitive information
- Fail-open behavior often leads to bypasses

**Attacker mindset:**  
“What happens when something goes wrong?”

---

## Minimize Attack Surface

**Definition:**  
Only necessary services, features, and endpoints should be exposed.

**Pentesting relevance:**
- Unused features are common entry points
- Larger attack surface increases risk

**Attacker mindset:**  
“What can I access that shouldn’t be here?”

---

## Visibility and Logging

**Definition:**  
Security-relevant actions should be logged and monitored.

**Pentesting relevance:**
- Poor visibility hides attacker activity
- Detection gaps increase dwell time

**Attacker mindset:**  
“Will anyone notice this?”

---

## Key Takeaways

- Security principles explain *why* vulnerabilities exist
- Violations create predictable attack patterns
- Pentesters use principles to assess design risk
- Good findings connect issues to violated principles
