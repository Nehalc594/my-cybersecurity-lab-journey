# Introduction to Web Hacking

This section focuses on **web application security from a penetration testing perspective**.

Modern applications are one of the most common attack targets due to:
- Direct internet exposure
- Complex business logic
- Heavy reliance on user input
- Integration with multiple backend systems

Web hacking in penetration testing is about **understanding application behavior**, not blindly exploiting vulnerabilities.

---

## What Web Penetration Testing Involves

Web application testing focuses on:
- How users interact with the application
- How the application processes requests
- How authentication and authorization are enforced
- How data is validated, stored, and returned

Many serious vulnerabilities arise from **logic flaws**, not technical bugs.

---

## Attacker and Defender Perspectives

From an attacker’s perspective:
- How can input be manipulated?
- What assumptions does the application make?
- Are workflows enforced correctly?

From a defender’s perspective:
- Are inputs validated server-side?
- Are access controls consistent?
- Is suspicious behavior logged and monitored?

Effective pentesting considers **both views**.

## Testing Philosophy

This section emphasizes:
- Manual analysis over automation
- Understanding application workflows
- Mapping findings to real-world risk
- Avoiding unnecessary exploitation

The goal is **risk identification and communication**, not system damage.
