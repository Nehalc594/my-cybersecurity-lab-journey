# Network Security

This section focuses on **network-level reconnaissance and analysis** as part of a penetration test.

Network security testing aims to:
- Identify exposed hosts and services
- Understand how systems communicate
- Detect weak configurations and trust relationships
- Assess attack surface at the infrastructure level

Network testing provides the **foundation** for deeper exploitation and privilege escalation.

## What Network Penetration Testing Involves

Network-focused testing includes:
- Discovering live hosts
- Identifying open ports and services
- Understanding protocols and their configurations
- Mapping trust boundaries between systems

The goal is **visibility and understanding**, not disruption.

---

## Testing Philosophy

This section emphasizes:
- Careful, scoped scanning
- Gradual escalation from passive to active techniques
- Accuracy over noise
- Respect for system stability and authorization

Network scanning should always be **intentional and controlled**.

---

## Attacker and Defender Perspectives

**Attacker view:**
- Which systems are reachable?
- What services are exposed?
- Are there misconfigurations or weak protocols?

**Defender view:**
- Are unnecessary services exposed?
- Is segmentation enforced?
- Is suspicious scanning detected and logged?

Effective testing considers both viewpoints.
