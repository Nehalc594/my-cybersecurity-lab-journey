# Vulnerability Research

This section focuses on **understanding, analyzing, and contextualizing vulnerabilities** as part of a penetration test.

Vulnerability research is not about exploiting everything that exists.  
It is about determining **what matters, why it matters, and how it should be addressed**.

## What Is Vulnerability Research?

Vulnerability research involves:
- Understanding how vulnerabilities arise
- Mapping weaknesses to real-world risk
- Evaluating exploitability and impact
- Prioritizing findings based on context

Effective research connects **technical details to business risk**.

---

## Why Vulnerability Research Matters

Not all vulnerabilities are equal.  
Organizations rely on testers to:
- Identify meaningful security weaknesses
- Avoid noise and false positives
- Explain impact in clear terms
- Provide actionable remediation guidance

Research quality directly affects report value.

## Vulnerabilities vs Exploits

- A **vulnerability** is a weakness in design, implementation, or configuration
- An **exploit** is one way a vulnerability might be abused

Penetration testers must understand vulnerabilities even when exploitation is:
- Unsafe
- Out of scope
- Unnecessary to demonstrate impact

---

## Sources of Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability research commonly draws from:
- Public vulnerability disclosures
- Vendor advisories
- Security research publications
- Observed application or service behavior

Understanding sources improves accuracy and credibility.

---

## Attacker Perspective

From an attacker’s mindset:
- “Is this vulnerability exploitable here?”
- “What access does it provide?”
- “Does context increase impact?”

Attackers focus on **practical abuse**, not theory.

---

## Defensive Perspective

From a defensive standpoint:
- Vulnerabilities must be prioritized realistically
- Patch management and configuration matter
- Context determines urgency
- Clear explanations support remediation

Good research improves security outcomes.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Vulnerability research drives meaningful findings
- Context determines risk, not severity alone
- Exploitation is not always required
- Clear analysis improves remediation
