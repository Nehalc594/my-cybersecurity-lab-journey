# Vulnerabilities 101

This section introduces **what vulnerabilities are, how they arise, and why they matter** in penetration testing and security assessments.

Understanding vulnerabilities at a conceptual level is essential before attempting validation or remediation.

---

## What Is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a **weakness** in:
- System design
- Software implementation
- Configuration
- Operational processes

If exploited, a vulnerability can compromise **confidentiality, integrity, or availability**.

---

## How Vulnerabilities Arise

Common causes include:
- Insecure design decisions
- Coding errors
- Misconfigurations
- Outdated software
- Weak access controls

Many vulnerabilities result from **human assumptions** rather than technical limitations.

---

## Vulnerability vs Risk

- A **vulnerability** is the weakness itself
- **Risk** considers likelihood and impact within a specific context

A vulnerability may exist without presenting significant risk, depending on:
- Exposure
- Exploitability
- Compensating controls

Context determines priority.

---

## Vulnerability Classification

Vulnerabilities are often categorized by:
- Affected component (application, network, OS)
- Impact (data exposure, privilege escalation)
- Root cause (design flaw, misconfiguration)

Classification helps testers communicate findings consistently.

---

## Attacker Perspective

From an attacker’s mindset:
- “Can this weakness be exploited here?”
- “What access does it provide?”
- “Does it chain with other issues?”

Attackers focus on **practical abuse paths**.

---

## Defensive Perspective

From a defensive standpoint:
- Not all vulnerabilities require the same urgency
- Context and exposure guide remediation
- Clear understanding improves prioritization

Effective remediation starts with accurate classification.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Treating all vulnerabilities equally
- Ignoring environmental context
- Confusing theoretical issues with real risk
- Over-relying on automated severity scores

---

## Key Takeaways

- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses, not guarantees of exploitation
- Context defines risk
- Classification improves communication
- Understanding fundamentals improves assessment quality
