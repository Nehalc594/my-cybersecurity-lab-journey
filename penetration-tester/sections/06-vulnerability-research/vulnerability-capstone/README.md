# Vulnerability Capstone

The Vulnerability Capstone brings together **vulnerability identification, research, and decision-making** into a single, applied perspective.

Rather than focusing on individual flaws, this capstone emphasizes **prioritization, context, and communication**.

---

## Purpose of the Capstone

This capstone is designed to:
- Reinforce vulnerability research concepts
- Practice evaluating real-world risk
- Apply judgment to determine what matters most
- Simulate professional assessment thinking

Success depends on **analysis, not exploitation**.

---

## Connecting Vulnerabilities to Risk

Effective vulnerability assessment requires:
- Understanding exposure and reachability
- Evaluating potential impact
- Considering existing controls
- Assessing likelihood of exploitation

Context transforms raw findings into meaningful insight.

---

## Prioritization and Decision-Making

Not all vulnerabilities should be treated equally.  
Professional testers must:
- Distinguish critical issues from noise
- Explain why certain findings matter
- Balance technical severity with business impact
- Support remediation planning

Clear prioritization improves security outcomes.

---

## Communication Matters

A vulnerability is only useful if it is:
- Clearly explained
- Accurately scoped
- Supported with evidence
- Actionable for remediation teams

The capstone emphasizes **communication as a core skill**.

---

## Attacker Perspective

From an attacker’s mindset:
- “Which weakness gives the most leverage?”
- “What can be combined for greater impact?”
- “Where is detection weakest?”

Attackers prioritize efficiency and access.

---

## Defensive Perspective

From a defensive standpoint:
- Prioritized findings enable focused remediation
- Context reduces unnecessary alarm
- Clear explanations improve trust and action

Strong analysis supports better defense.

---

## Lessons Learned

Key lessons from the capstone include:
- Research quality drives report value
- Context outweighs raw severity scores
- Exploitation is not always required
- Clear communication strengthens impact

---

## Key Takeaways

- Vulnerability assessment is about judgment
- Context defines risk
- Prioritization is essential
- Communication completes the process
