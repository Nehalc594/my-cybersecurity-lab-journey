---

## What This Room Covers
- Purpose of secure networking protocols
- How encryption protects data in transit
- Differences between secure and insecure protocols

## Key Concepts
- Secure protocols encrypt data to prevent interception
- Authentication ensures communication with trusted parties
- Insecure protocols expose data to eavesdropping and manipulation

## Security Perspective
- Offensive: attackers target weak or unencrypted communications
- Defensive: defenders enforce secure protocols to protect data

## Key Takeaways
- Encryption is essential for protecting network traffic
- Secure protocols reduce the risk of interception attacks
- Disabling insecure protocols improves overall security
