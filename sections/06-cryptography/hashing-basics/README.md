## What This Room Covers
- Purpose of hashing in cybersecurity
- Difference between hashing and encryption
- Use of hashes for integrity and password storage

## Key Concepts
- Hashing is a one-way transformation
- The same input always produces the same hash
- Secure hashes are designed to resist reversal and collisions

## Security Perspective
- Offensive: attackers attempt to crack weak or unsalted hashes
- Defensive: defenders use strong hashing algorithms and salting

## Key Takeaways
- Hashing is critical for protecting stored credentials
- Weak hashing leads to credential compromise
- Integrity checks rely on trusted hash values
