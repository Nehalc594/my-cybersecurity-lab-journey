## What This Room Covers
- Purpose of public key (asymmetric) cryptography
- Differences between public and private keys
- How asymmetric cryptography enables secure communication

## Key Concepts
- Public keys can be shared openly; private keys must be protected
- Asymmetric cryptography solves key distribution problems
- Public key cryptography is used for encryption, authentication, and key exchange

## Security Perspective
- Offensive: attackers attempt to steal private keys or misuse weak implementations
- Defensive: defenders rely on strong key management and secure algorithms

## Key Takeaways
- Public key cryptography is foundational to HTTPS and secure systems
- Private key protection is critical to security
- Mismanagement of keys can compromise entire systems
