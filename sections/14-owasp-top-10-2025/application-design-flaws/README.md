**Section:** OWASP Top 10 (2025)  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Status:** Completed  

---

## What This Room Covers
- Security issues caused by poor application design
- Difference between design flaws and implementation bugs
- Importance of secure architecture from the start

## Key Concepts
- Design flaws affect entire application logic
- Fixing design issues is harder than fixing code bugs
- Threat modeling helps identify design risks early

## Security Perspective
- Offensive: attackers abuse flawed workflows and trust assumptions
- Defensive: secure design reduces entire classes of vulnerabilities

## Key Takeaways
- Security must be built into design, not added later
- Threat modeling improves architectural decisions
- Good design significantly reduces attack surface
